This is a basic MERN e-commerce project based on Brad Travesy MERN course on Udemy. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of the MERN stack despite the project being small in size as compared to the ones I worked with in a professional capacity.

Features that are included in this project:

<ol>
<li>Backend authentication using JWT</li> 
<li>Express middleware to determine whether user is an admin</li>
<li>API for user and for products. </li> 
<li>Uses MongoDB as a database<li></ol>
